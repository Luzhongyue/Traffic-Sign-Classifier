# Traffic-Sign-Classifier
---
## Overview

Implemention a convolutional neural networks based the [Lenet](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf) architecture using TensorFlow so it can decode traffic signs from natural images by using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).After the model is trained, then testing the model program on new images of traffic signs found on the web.
The steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Dependencies

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
- [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org)
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) (Optional)

## Dataset and Repository

1. [Download the data set](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/traffic-signs-data.zip). This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32. It contains a training, validation and test set.
2. Clone the project, which contains the Ipython notebook and the writeup template.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
cd CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
jupyter notebook Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb
